# Multivariate Time Series Models in Keras
This repository contains a throughout explanation on how to create different deep learning models in Keras for multivariate (tabular) time-series prediction. The data being used in this repository is from the [KB-74 Opschaler](https://github.com/deKeijzer/KB-74-OPSCHALER) project. The goal of this project is to do gas consumption prediction of houses on an hourly resolution, for the minor Applied Data Science at The Hague University of Applied Sciences.
